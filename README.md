# YourAverageSynth
This is a custom Audio Unit synth plugin project compatible only with OS X.
This project is for experimental purposes. Please notify me by email at sunquan8094@gmail.com if you have questions, concerns, tips, or substantial contributions to this project.

Here is the list of what I have so far up until the latest commit:
- saw, sine, and square waveforms
- lowpass and highpass filters, bandpass filter to come soon
